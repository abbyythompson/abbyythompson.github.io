              <h2 class="explanationHeader"> The problem </h2>
              <h2 class="coloredFont marginBottom">- </h2>
              <p><span class='highlight bold'>Innovation comes from finding a problem, solving it and creating tangible value for those faced with that problem.  </span></p>

              <p>Our team decided to solve a pain point for discrete manufacturing enterprises. Since these enterprises have to create so many unique products they have a plethora of unorganised material offcuts.</p>
              <img class="centerImg" src="assets/img/problem.png"></img>
              <p>After an intern experience at a discrete manufacturer, this problem was observed. A lack of material management resulted in a wastage, time and ultimately money for the enterprise. </p>

            </div>
            <div class="section">
              <h2 class="explanationHeader">The solution </h2>
              <h2 class="coloredFont marginBottom">- </h2>
              <p><span class='highlight bold'> An exploration of innovative ways to create a beneficial and meaningful solution to the user. </span></p>

              <p>Our solution was to create an inventory management solution for discrete manufacturing enterprises. We envisioned an application that could track, modify, remove, and reserve materials.
                The product would be able to keep track of where workers have placed materials and instruct the team on where to store catalogued materials.</p>

            <div class="section">
              <h2 class="explanationHeader">The Market </h2>
              <h2 class="coloredFont marginBottom">- </h2>
              <p><span class="highlight bold">To find a solution to a problem is one thing, but if that solution does not have a market nor provide a useful purpose there is no point.</span>
            </p>
            <p>Our applicable market is discrete manufacturing enterprises. Since large enterprises already have their own systems, our target market narrowed down to small to medium enterprises. The addressable market size was calculated through valid statistics and reasonable estimations of product adoption. New Zealand was found to have around 19,000 small to medium discrete manufacturing enterprises.
              <span class="italics"> We were advised to initially roll out the product locally before expanding globally as this would provide feedback on product success and onboarding performance.</span>
               </p>

            <p>Simply put, we used a bottom-up approach to figure out specifically how many enterprises would buy our product and calculate a Total Addressable Market. This total addressable market value gives a good prediction of whether any investment will be rewarded.

              <h2 class="explanationHeader">The Competition </h2>

              <p> <span class="highlight bold">Understanding the competition is necessary. Why would someone prefer our product over something else? </span> </p>

              <p> We recognized the existence of competing products. Competing companies had inventory products that were hard to use, time exhaustive and/or expensive.</p>
              <p> Our differentiation relied on our ability to harness AR technology and thus create an outstanding user experience. The value-adds important to our market included </p>
              <ul class="bulletList">
                  <li class="bulletPoint"><p> Ease of use </p></li>
                  <li class="bulletPoint"><p> Intuitiveness </p></li>
                  <li class="bulletPoint"><p> Affordability </p></li>
                  <li class="bulletPoint"><p> Time efficiency </p></li>
              </ul>
              <p> All these value-adds result in savings of material, time and money. </p>

              <p>We collaboratively mapped out our minimal viable product. <span class="highlight">What were the key features that our market needed? Do these features provide our competitive value-adds?</span></p>

              <p> I played a fundamental role in lightly exploring mobile user experience. These UI designs added to the investment pitch and brought further understanding for user experience feasibility. </p>

            <div class="section">
              <h2 class="explanationHeader">The Takeaway </h2>
              <h2 class="coloredFont marginBottom">- </h2>
              <p>Through this course, I learnt a whole lot about entrepreneurship. Validation of ideas, building realistic business models and pitching informed value propositions to potential investors. This all culminated in a group pitch to the lecturer to secure investment in the product and the team. The team pitched an estimated timeline for the product which included the MVP build, local/national business rollout, to eventual world domination and numbers to back up the scaling.
              We eventually entered our idea in a competition under the name STACD, which earnt us $1,000 in an Innovation Challenge through the University.</p>

              <p><span class="highlight bold"> I ultimately learnt that building a product is more than having a great idea. It's about building a business model around a useful user-centric product that has a tangible market.</span> </p>
