            <p>My honours project involved developing a product from scratch. My partner and I worked with a company sponsor to design and develop a product to reflect their varying requirements.</p>
              <p><span class="thin"><span class="bold">Core transferrable skills:</span> Requirement management, Agile product design and development, Diverse usability testing.</span></p>

              <h2 class="explanationHeader"> The Project </h2>
              <h2 class="coloredFont marginBottom">- </h2>
              <p><span class='highlight bold'>This project relied on managing expectations, understanding requirements and remaining agile in the process. </span></p>

              <p>The product was pitched to be a cloud-based web application for the use of the company's service team. We researched what tools and technologies were most suitable for the situation. Then we designed and built the product with continuous feedback. Towards the end then carried out a product usability test with a number of their team to collect user data and improve the product. </p>

              <h2 class="explanationHeader">The Requirements </h2>
              <h2 class="coloredFont marginBottom">- </h2>
              <p><span class='highlight bold'> Collecting, interpreting and utilizing the requirements were crucial for this product. </span></p>
              <p> The handful of guys who put a face to the company became our mentors. They provided constant feedback throughout the project.
                </p>
              <p> At the very beginning, we sat down and talked through their idea of the product. The requirements were understood and we clarified any assumptions to allow for complete transparency and assurance that we were all on the same page. </p>
              <p> Constant communication with our mentors resulted in better product agility to adapt to any change in requirements.  </p>

            <div class="section">
              <h2 class="explanationHeader">The Design </h2>
              <h2 class="coloredFont marginBottom">- </h2>
              <p><span class="highlight bold">We had to understand the user to create a fundamentally useful product</span></p>
              <p>There were two parts to the design. The technology stack and the user interface/experience.  </p>
              <p>The initial steps were to understanding the user experience we needed to create. We dived into learning more about every user that will touch the product. Our mentors were very helpful when giving us all the information about their team that would be using the tool.</p>
              <p>This research gave us a great platform to mock up screens from low to high fidelity with a lot of input at each point. Utilizing our user flows and user profiles at each step of design would ensure we were aligned to the requirements.</p>
              <p>When designing the technology stack, we realised a large portion was going to be biased to the companies' requirements but we still decided to look into the pros and cons of possible technology options, especially in the front end. </p>

            <div class="section">
              <h2 class="explanationHeader">The Testing </h2>
              <h2 class="coloredFont marginBottom">- </h2>
              <p> <span class="highlight bold"> The usability testing ensured we utilized different points of view than our own and uncovered sub-par parts of the product that we were blind to due to our bias. </span> </p>
              <p>After building the product we decided to test it with enough time to improve the UX. The testing of the product involved a variety of usability testing on a number of team members. To carry out our usability testing we created a semi-structured interview for each of the participants. It consisted of three parts. The first part was making the user carry out specific tasks. The second were Likert scale questions and finally, we posed open-ended answer questions for the participants to answer.</p>
              <p> We analyzed our collected data and successfully altered the application. After having carried out two usability tests, we were able to quantitatively see the improvement in our product's overall intuitiveness.
                It was extremely helpful in understanding their perspective on the UI and the whole experience.   </p>

              <h2 class="explanationHeader">The Takeaway </h2>
              <h2 class="coloredFont marginBottom">- </h2>
              <!-- <p><span class="highlight bold"> I ultimately learnt that building a product is more than having a great idea. It's about building a business model around a useful user-centric product that has a tangible market.</span> </p> -->
              <p>It was extremely satisfying to have managed to produce a full web application over the span of a year. I think the most important part of the process was working with the company. It was insightful to see how to work with a client, of sorts, to understand their requirements and make sure that we were able to adapt when their vision changed at all. </p>
